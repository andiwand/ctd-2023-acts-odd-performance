# Reconstruction performance with ACTS and the Open Data Detector

Simulation, reconstruction and plotting for our contribution at [Connecting The Dots 2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1252748/contributions/5521502)

## Abstract

Over the last years, the ACTS software has matured in functionality and performance while at the same time the Open Data Detector (ODD), a revision and evolution of the TrackML detector, has been established. Together they form a foundation for algorithmic research and performance evaluation also for detectors with time measurements, like the ODD. In this contribution we present the performance for reference physics samples as a baseline for a reconstruction chain implemented with ACTS for silicon based detectors. This serves as a validation for both the ODD geometry and the ACTS reconstruction algorithms. At the same time it is a reference for experiments looking into ACTS reconstruction performance. Additionally, we use it to validate the ACTS intrinsic fast track simulation (ActsFatras) and present a coherent continuous integration testing suite to monitor performance changes over time.
